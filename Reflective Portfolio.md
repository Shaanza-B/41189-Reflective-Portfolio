# My Reflective Portfolio 

## Week 1

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned about complex systems and complicated systems and how they are different from each other.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The different boundaries of systems. They include the open system, the closed system and the isolated system.*

### What insights have I gained?

*There are many definitions of a system, but they all have a common meaning ultimately.*

### What are (my/the) percieved strengths and weaknesses that I observed?

*I can understand better with real life examples and with visual representations.*


## Week 2

### What have I learned this week?

*That many models are good but too many models aren't good.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*Modelling can bring clarity to our thoughts and it is important to use models in a lot of cases.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That there are more than one uses to models. I used to think that it is just to bring clarity and see the future possible outcome in a simplified way, but there is more.*
