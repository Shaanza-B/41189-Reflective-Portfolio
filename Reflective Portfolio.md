# My Reflective Portfolio 

## Week 1

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned about complex systems and complicated systems and how they are different from each other.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The different boundaries of systems. They include the open system, the closed system and the isolated system.*

### What insights have I gained?

*There are many definitions of a system, but they all have a common meaning ultimately.*

### What are (my/the) percieved strengths and weaknesses that I observed?

*I can understand better with real life examples and with visual representations.*


## Week 2

### What have I learned this week?

*That many models are good but too many models aren't good.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*Modelling can bring clarity to our thoughts and it is important to use models in a lot of cases.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That there are more than one uses to models. I used to think that it is just to bring clarity and see the future possible outcome in a simplified way, but there is more.*


## Week 3

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different factors that have an effect on people's decision making process.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*I learned about the different models that can determine a person's decision making process.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That biases can't be completely eradicated for decision making, even if it is required.*


## Week 4

### What have I learned this week?

*The different models that allow the understanding of complex systems. These models are the agent-based models, network models and system dynamic models. System dynamic models produce a general understanding of a complex system. Agent based models show the interaction between different agents to show how they effect the whole together.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*I did not know about these models and how they go in detail to explain interactions between their factors to further understand the complex system as a whole.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Not all models can be used to figure out the same thing.*

### What were the challenged I encountered?

*Understanding all the models was difficult at first, because of how I was not aware of them before, but by going over them and understanding them in different contexts it gave me a better understanding of them and how they can be used.*


## Week 5

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different types of graphs for probability, and not just one. And there are multiple types of random variables.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The multiple types of random variables. This includes discrete random variables and continuous random variables.*

### What insights have I gained?

*How real world examples of probability usage show the differences in the graphs used.*


## Week 6

### What have I learned this week?

*About markov models. They are models that take previous states into consideration to figure out the future state. It uses probabilities to find that. There are a limited number of states that can occur and they are not simple cycles.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The markov model can be used in a lot of areas. It is a rather useful model to use to understand future states.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Some models may seem complex at first but once they are understood they are quite useful to consider using in the future for decision making.*

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

*After learning more about the markov model I realised one of my weaknesses is that I tend to assume before looking into a new topic that it will be a difficult one, even though later on it is not hard.*


## Week 7

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different ways to show how things are spread. They are shown by social contagion models, which include Schelling's segregation model, Granovetter's riot model and Standing Ovation model.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*About the new models that help understand why and how things spread.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Many models can go hand in hand to figure out the way some systems work.*


## Week 8

### What have I learned this week?

*About the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Colonel blotto game. They both show how different combinations and probabilities can have very different outcomes.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*Regarding the Colonel blotto game, it showed that there is not necessarily a right way to do things, as multiple combinations and strategies can fail.*

### What insights have I gained?

*There can be many right combinations and decisions to make, however it depends on what is needed at the time.*


## Week 9

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned more about the markov model and how it can be used.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The use of probability can be used in more cases than I knew before. There is definitely a right way to use it, but it is a very useful tool*

### What insights have I gained?

*The markov model is a useful tool that can help determine future states taking the previous and current states in consideration.*

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

*I can work in a group really well when there is open communication. My group is open and honest about what we want to achieve, and I can work well with them.*


## Week 10

### What have I learned this week?

*That markov models can be represented in code form, and it is quite useful to do so.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*That markov chains are a way to show markov models in Python.*

### What insights have I gained?

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

*I've never quite liked coding, but I learned that if I put my mind to it and try and understand it it is quite enjoyable and interesting. I'd say that I'm open to learning new things.*

### What were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I/my team handle them?

*We were all new to Python and the idea of the models, but with collective team work and helping each other we learned to distribute the work evenly amongst each other and made sure everyone was sure of what we were supposed to do.*


## Week 11

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned more about the markov chain which is a way to show the markov model on Python and the variables needed.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*About the different variables needed in the markov chain and how they work.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That understanding code is better than just memorising it.*


## Week 12

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned more aobut the markov chain.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*How probability is used in the markov chain to represent different states.*

### What insights have I gained?

### What are my perceived weaknesses and strengths that I have observed?

*I learned that I can be quite impatient when running code and especially when it turns out to not work, which is a weakness.*

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated result?

*It is better to be patient and understand what is wrong with the code. This way it will be easier figuring things out and getting the right result quickly.*
