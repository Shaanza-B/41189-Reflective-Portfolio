# My Reflective Portfolio 

## Week 1

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned about complex systems and complicated systems and how they are different from each other.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The different boundaries of systems. They include the open system, the closed system and the isolated system.*

### What insights have I gained?

*There are many definitions of a system, but they all have a common meaning ultimately.*

### What are (my/the) percieved strengths and weaknesses that I observed?

*I can understand better with real life examples and with visual representations.*


## Week 2

### What have I learned this week?

*That many models are good but too many models aren't good.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*Modelling can bring clarity to our thoughts and it is important to use models in a lot of cases.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That there are more than one uses to models. I used to think that it is just to bring clarity and see the future possible outcome in a simplified way, but there is more.*


## Week 3

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different factors that have an effect on people's decision making process.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*I learned about the different models that can determine a person's decision making process.*

### What insights have I gained?

*That biases can't be completely eradicated for decision making, even if it is required.*


## Week 4

### What have I learned this week?

*The different models that allow the understanding of complex systems. These models are the agent-based models, network models and system dynamic models. System dynamic models produce a general understanding of a complex system. Agent based models show the interaction between different agents to show how they effect the whole together.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*I did not know about these models and how they go in detail to explain interactions between their factors to further understand the complex system as a whole.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Not all models can be used to figure out the same thing.*

### What were the challenged I encountered?

*Understanding all the models was difficult at first, because of how I was not aware of them before, but by going over them and understanding them in different contexts it gave me a better understanding of them and how they can be used.*


## Week 5

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different types of graphs for probability, and not just one. And there are multiple types of random variables.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The multiple types of random variables. This includes discrete random variables and continuous random variables.*

### What insights have I gained?

*How real world examples of probability usage show the differences in the graphs used.*


## Week 6

### What have I learned this week?

*About markov models. They are models that take previous states into consideration to figure out the future state. It uses probabilities to find that. There are a limited number of states that can occur and they are not simple cycles.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The markov model can be used in a lot of areas. It is a rather useful model to use to understand future states.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Some models may seem complex at first but once they are understood they are quite useful to consider using in the future for decision making.*

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

*After learning more about the markov model I realised one of my weaknesses is that I tend to assume before looking into a new topic that it will be a difficult one, even though later on it is not hard.*


## Week 7

### What have I learned this week?

*There are different ways to show how things are spread. They are shown by social contagion models, which include Schelling's segregation model, Granovetter's riot model and Standing Ovation model.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*About the new models that help understand why and how things spread.*

### What insights have I gained?

*Many models can go hand in hand to figure out the way some systems work.*
