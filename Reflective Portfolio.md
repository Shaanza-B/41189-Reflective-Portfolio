## Week 1

### What have I learned this week?

*I learned about complex systems and complicated systems and how they are different from each other.*

### What do I "now know" that I did not before?

*The different boundaries of systems. They include the open system, the closed system and the isolated system.*

### What insights have I gained?

*There are many definitions of a system, but they all have a common meaning ultimately.*

### What are (my/the) percieved strengths and weaknesses that I observed?

*I can understand better with real life examples and with visual representations.*
